# AE2223-I: Analysing the L2-error of novel FEM methods 
The code for the data analysis of the project AE2223-I.
The data was generated by our tutor and analysed using this code.
The results of that analysis is also contained in this repository.

## Usage:

1. Set the directory path in error_pd.py at parentdir and set the output path
1. run error_pd.py to generate the L2-error analysis for the data given in that directory.
1. Set the correct path to the generated analysis files in graphingGui.py
1. run graphingGUI.py to try out various combinations of parameters to get the best graphs.

## TODO

1. Add functionality to plot the desired plot in more detail with more text.
