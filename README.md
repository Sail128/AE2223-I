# AE2223-I: Analysing the L2-error of novel FEM methods 

The code for the data analysis of the project AE2223-I.
The data was generated by our tutor and analysed using this code.
The results of that analysis is also contained in this repository.

## What needs to be plotted:

* convergence plot for h and N. So for the 3 methods plotting the log of L2-error versus N, h and log(h)
* convergence for div(u)-f also on N, h and log(h).
* add the integral values to get one value for a system and plot how that varies with h and P-refinement
* plotting with both c=0.0 and c=0.3

## Usage:

1. Set the directory path in error_pd.py at parentdir and set the output path
1. run error_pd.py to generate the L2-error analysis for the data given in that directory.
1. Set the correct path to the generated analysis files in graphingGui.py
1. run graphingGUI.py to try out various combinations of parameters to get the best graphs.
    1. add a savefile name to output a latex plot for more customization.
